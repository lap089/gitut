## Git Basics

###  Git configuration
* Username:  
  ```git config --global user.name "Your Name"```
* E-mail:  
  ```git config --global user.email "your@email.com"```
* Editor:  
  ```git config --global core.editor editor-shortcut```  
  ```git config --global core.editor "path/to/your/edtitor"```
* Get a specific configuration:  
  ```git config [field]```
* List all configrations:  
  ```git config --list```

### Git workspace setup
* **Initialize** current folder for Git system: (required to be an empty folder)  
  ```git init```
* **Initialize** a new child folder (of current one) for Git system:  
  ```git init [path]```
* **Clone** an existing repository to _current_ folder: (empty folder required)  
  ```git clone [repository-url]```
* **Clone** an existing repository to a _child_ folder of current: (empty folder required)  
  ```git clone [repository-url] [path]```

### Git Lifecycle
* Overview:

![Git lifecycle](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/book/02-git-basics/images/lifecycle.png)

* **Add** a file to staged: (from both untracked and modified)
  * A specific _folder/file_:  
    ```git add [path]```
  * _Everything_:  
    ```git add [ * | . | -A ]```
  * _Everything_ **except** _removed_ files:  
    ```git add --ignore-removal .```
  * _Everything_ **except** _new_ files: (```-u``` stands for "update")  
    ```git add -u```
* **Removal**:  
  * Remove a file completely from _staged_ or _unmodified_ area and _stage_ that removal:  
    * As above: (recommended)  
      ```git rm [path]```
    * So below:  
    ```rm [path]```  
    ```git add [path]```
  * Remove ```[path]``` in the _next commit_ but results in **new** file which is **untracked**.  
    ```git rm --cached [path]```
* **Unstage**:
  * A _file_:  
    ```git reset [path]```
  * _Everything_:  
    ```git reset```
* **Undo** everything and revert:  
  ```git reset --hard [ | [commit] ]```
  * `[ ]`: empty means revert to the latest commit.
  * `[commit]`: revert to commit with SHA-1 hash ID `[commit]`
* **Move** a file from one place to another and stage it: (also for **rename** purpose)
  * As above: (recommended)  
  ```git mv [from-path] [to-path]```
  * So below:  
    ```mv [from-path] [to-path]```  
    ```git rm [from-path]```  
    ```git add [to-path]```
* **Commit** from staged to unmodified:
  * Commit with an _inline_ message:  
    ```git commit -m```
  * Commit with a pop-up _editor_ (specified by core.editor):  
    ```git commit```
  * Commit by _replacing_ the last commit:  
    ```git commit [ | -m ] --amend```
* Check **status** of current workspace:
  * Status of workspace in general:  
    ```git status```
  * Log of commits throughout the history:  
    ```git log [ | -p | --stat | --pretty ]```
    * ```-p```: _difference_ between each commits.
    * ```--stat```: how many _lines_ are modified, inserted or removed
    * ```--pretty```: show logs with specified _format_. Go [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/pretty-formats) for more infos.
    * **Trick**:
      ```git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate```

### Git Branch
* **Create** a new branch:   
  ```git branch [branch-name]```
* **Rename** a branch:
  * _Current_ branch:  
    ```git branch -m [new-name]```
  * _Another_ branch: 
    ```git branch -m [new-name] [branch-name```
* **Switch** to another branch:  
  * _Requirements_ for switching is current workspace must be **clean**.  
    No untracked files or modified files that haven't been committed.
  * If a branch already _exists_:  
  ```git checkout [branch-name]```
  * If a branch does _not exist_ and it should be created:
    * As bove: (recommended)  
      ```git checkout -b [branch-name]```
    * So below:  
      ```git branch [branch-name]```  
      ```git checkout [branch-name]```
* **Merge** work from `[branch-name]` to _current_ branch:  
  ```git merge [branch-name]```
  * **Conflicts**:  
  ```<<<<<<< HEAD:[conflicted-file]```   
  ```[Code exists in current-branch]```  
  ``` ======= ```  
  ```[Code exists in branch-name]```  
  ```>>>>>>> [branch-name]:[conflicted-file]```
    * Resolve conflicts and remove ```<<<<<<<```, ``` ======= ``` and ```>>>>>>>```.
    * Add the ```[conflicted-file]``` to staged and then it is merged.
* **Delete** a branch:
  ```git branch [ -d | -D ] [branch-name]```
  * ```-d```: delete a branch but canceled if that branch is not merged to its parent (with _warning_).
  * ```-D```: _force_ a delete on a branch (without any warning)
* **List** all branches:  
  ```git branch [ | -v | --merged | --no-merged ]```
  * ```-v```: show branches with their last commits
  * ```--merged```: branches _merged_ to current branch.
  * ```--no-merged```: branches _not merged_ to current branch.
* **Branch** is just an **alias** for a **commit**. Therefore, `checkout` can be applied to move `HEAD` to a commit:  
  ```git checkout [commit-id]```
  * Checking out this way results in "detaching" `HEAD` from branches (no branch is attached with HEAD).
    * Create a new branch and that branch is attached to current commit with HEAD.
    * Otherwise, any new commit is not tracked by any branch but `HEAD`'s **history** can be shown to see it:  
      ```git reflog```
* **Stash**: _save_ all _working tree_ and the _staged area~ (the index) to a "safe" place
  ```git stash [ | save ]```
  * _Show_ shashes:
    * All stashes:  
      ```git stash list```
    * A stash:
      ```git stash show stash@{i}```
  * _Apply_ a stash:
    * Most recent one:
      ```git stash apply```
    * At a stash history: (with the format `stash@{i}`, retrieved from `git stash show`)
      ```git stash apply stash@{i}```
  * _Drop_ a stash:
    * Most recent one:  
      ```git stash drop```
    * At a stash history:  
      ```git stash drop stash@{i}```
  * _Choose file to stash:
      ```git stash -p```
      


## Workflow

These are simple scenarios when using Git.

### Scenario 1

There is no other branch than your `master`. You have not changed anything but want to make some (fix issue or add new features).

1.  Create a new branch and check it out:  
  ```git checkout -b [branch-name]```
2.  Push it to remote Git so that others know you're working on a new branch:  
  ```git push [remote] [remote-branch-name]```  
  * If you don't have the `[remote-branch-name]` on `[remote]` yet, above command automatically creates that branch for you.
3.  Fix issue/ Add new features.
4.  Commit as soon as possible.
5.  If the issue is fixed or new features are completed, go to 6. Otherwise, go back to 3.
6.  Push local branch to remote branch:  
  ```git push [remote] [remote-branch-name]```
7.  Open a pull request so that responsible engineers can review or test your code.
8.  Repeat 3 to 6 until your request is approved.
9.  Merge your pull request with the `master` (and resolve any conflicts if there are before merging).

### Scenario 2

During [Scenario 1](#scenario-1) from step 3 to 8, if there is a severe problem that needs to be fixed and other cannot wait until you finish your job, do the following:

1.  Make sure your working tree is clean. (Everything is committed)  
2.  Apply the same steps (1 to 9) in [Scenario 1](#s1).  
3.  Checkout `master` to update:  
  ```git checkout master```  
  ```git pull [remote] master```  
5.  Checkout `[branch-name]` to update it from master:  
  ```git checkout [branch-name]```  
  ```git merge master```  
6.  If you're working on children levels of `[branch-name]`, you can propagate updates the same way as above.

### Scenario 3

During [Scenario 1](#scenario-1), if there's someone changed the `master` branch on remote, it is recommended that you should update yours to avoid resolve accumulated conflicts in the future (although you can do this at your convenience).

1.  Make sure your working tree is clean. (Everything is committed)
2.  Checkout `master` to update:
  ```git checkout master```  
  ```git pull [remote] master```
3.  Checkout `[branch-name]` to update it from master:
  ```git checkout [branch-name]```
  ```git merge master```
4.  If you're working on children levels of `[branch-name]`, you can propagate updates the same way as above.
